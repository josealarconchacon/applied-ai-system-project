# PawPal+ — Applied AI System (Agentic Scheduling)

## Base Project

This project extends **PawPal+**, originally built as a Module 2 assignment. The original PawPal+ is a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan daily care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, grooming) for one or more pets, generating a priority-based schedule that fits within a daily time budget and detecting scheduling conflicts within a single pet's tasks.

## Summary

PawPal+ now includes an **agentic scheduling workflow**: instead of just detecting scheduling conflicts and reporting them, a `SchedulingAgent` plans, generates, checks its own work, and automatically resolves conflicts by rescheduling the lower-priority task past the higher-priority task's full duration. This turns a passive conflict _detector_ into an active conflict _resolver_, fully logged and testable.

## ✨ Features

- Pet and owner profile management (`Owner`, `Pet` classes)
- Priority-based schedule generation that fits tasks into a daily time budget (`Schedule.generate()`)
- Sorting tasks by scheduled time (`Schedule.sort_by_time()`)
- Filtering tasks by completion status and/or pet name (`Schedule.filter_tasks()`)
- Conflict detection for tasks scheduled at the exact same time (`Schedule.detect_conflicts()`)
- Recurring daily/weekly task logic that generates the next occurrence when a task is completed (`Task.mark_complete()`)
- A Streamlit UI for adding pets and tasks, generating a schedule, and viewing sorted results, filters, and conflict warnings (`app.py`)
- Multi-pet support with per-pet task isolation and active-pet scheduling (`app.py`, `Task.pet_name`)
- Mark complete with safe recurrence surfaced in the UI — clicking "Mark complete" marks a daily/weekly task done and appends the next occurrence automatically
- Task removal via "Remove" button (`Owner.remove_task()`)
- Pet profile display using `get_care_profile()` and `has_special_needs()`
- Priority tiebreaker scheduling based on owner's preferred time of day (`Schedule.generate()`)
- Input validation on the Add Pet form: age must be at least 1, and adding a pet with the same name and age as an existing pet requires explicit confirmation before the duplicate is saved
- Agentic scheduling workflow that plans, generates, checks for conflicts, and self-corrects by rescheduling the lower-priority (or tiebreak-losing) task past the conflicting task's duration (`SchedulingAgent` in `agent.py`)

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system's data flow is documented in `diagrams/architecture.mmd` (Mermaid source). At a high level: Owner/Pet/Task input flows into the `SchedulingAgent`, which runs a Plan → Act → Check → Resolve loop against the `Schedule` class until no conflicts remain (capped at 3 attempts). The resulting conflict-free schedule and a structured activity log are the output, which then get verified two ways: an automated pytest suite and manual review of AI-generated code changes before acceptance.

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

The following are real, reproducible input/output pairs from this system — not illustrative examples.

## 🧠 Design Decisions

**Rule-based agent, not an LLM call.** An agentic workflow just means something that can plan, act, and check its own work, it doesn't have to involve calling a model. I kept mine rule-based on purpose. I needed the agent's behavior to be predictable so I could actually test it. Adding an LLM call would've introduced randomness into the exact part of the system meant to prove it's reliable, which felt like working against myself. It also meant one less thing that could break, no API keys, no rate limits, no network calls failing mid-loop.

**Tiebreak order for conflict resolution:** priority first, then the owner's preferred time of day, then alphabetical order as a last resort. I used the same order `Schedule.generate()` already uses for its own tiebreaks, since I didn't want two different rules in the same system for deciding "which task wins." One consistent rule is easier to reason about and easier to explain later.

**Shifting past the conflicting task's actual duration, not a fixed increment.** My first version just moved the losing task by a flat 15 minutes. That worked fine until I tested it against a longer task and realized 15 minutes wasn't always enough, the moved task could still land right in the middle of it. So I changed it to shift the task to start exactly when the other one ends. Now it's guaranteed to clear, not just usually clear.

**A cap on how many times the agent will try to fix things (`max_resolution_attempts`, default 3).** I didn't want the agent stuck retrying forever if it ran into a conflict it genuinely couldn't resolve. Capping it at 3 attempts means it always stops, one way or another, and honestly reports `"unresolved"` if it couldn't finish the job instead of just hanging.

## 🛡️ Reliability & Guardrails

The agent's reliability mechanisms are verified by specific tests in `test_agent.py`. Each row below is a real, passing test case.

| Test Input                                                                   | Guardrail / Mechanism                        | Result                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Two tasks, same time, different priority                                     | Conflict resolution + priority tiebreak      | ✅ Pass — lower-priority task moved, higher-priority task untouched                                                                                |
| Two tasks, same time, same priority, neither matching owner's preferred time | Alphabetical tiebreak fallback               | ✅ Pass — alphabetically later task moved                                                                                                          |
| `tasks=[None]` (invalid input)                                               | `try/except` guardrail inside `act()`        | ✅ Pass — returns `status: "error"` and logs the failure instead of crashing                                                                       |
| A conflict that never clears (mocked `detect_conflicts()`)                   | `max_resolution_attempts` cap                | ✅ Pass — agent stops after the configured attempt limit and reports `status: "unresolved"` instead of looping forever                             |
| Two tasks, same time, different durations                                    | Duration-aware shift (not a fixed increment) | ✅ Pass — the moved task is shifted past the _entire_ other task's duration, confirmed by an exact time assertion, not just "some change happened" |

These five tests, alongside the other 21 in the suite, run automatically with `pytest tests/test_agent.py tests/test_pawpal.py`.

=============================== 19 passed in 0.04s ================================
```

The 19 tests cover the core scheduling behaviors built into PawPal+, marking tasks as complete and verifying that daily/weekly recurring tasks correctly generate a next occurrence. They also validate schedule generation, making sure high-priority tasks are placed first and that tasks exceeding the available time budget get skipped. Beyond that, the suite checks that `sort_by_time()` returns slots in the right order, that `filter_tasks()` correctly narrows results by completion status or pet name, and that `detect_conflicts()` catches two tasks assigned to the same time slot.

Since the agentic workflow was added, the suite has grown to 26 tests total: the original 19 plus 7 new tests in `test_agent.py` covering the `SchedulingAgent`'s no-conflict path, priority-based tiebreak, alphabetical tiebreak, full step-by-step logging, error handling when `act()` fails, the `max_resolution_attempts` cutoff, and most importantly, a test that checks the agent's conflict resolution clears a task's _entire_ duration. That last test exists specifically because an earlier version of the agent only shifted a conflicting task by a flat 15 minutes, which could still overlap a longer task. The test now locks in the fix.

Confidence Level: ⭐⭐⭐½ (3.5/5)

I'm fairly confident in this system, all 19 tests pass and they actually cover the behaviors that matter most, sorting, filtering, conflict detection, and recurrence. But I'm not giving it a full 5 stars because I know firsthand that passing tests don't catch everything. For example, earlier in this project, sort_by_time() quietly got changed to sort by the wrong field, and none of my tests caught it since I hadn't written tests for that method yet at the time, I only caught it because I happened to look closely at the terminal output and it didn't match what I expected. That experience made me trust my test suite more, but also made me realize that a green checkmark only means what I actually wrote tests for, not that the whole system is bulletproof.

| Task sorting      | `Schedule.sort_by_time()`     | Returns a new list of slots sorted by `scheduled_time`, doesn't mutate `self.slots`. Tasks with no `scheduled_time` sort last.                                                                                                    |

## 📸 Demo Walkthrough

The main page lays out all inputs in a single vertical flow, nothing hidden or gated.

**Owner section** — three fields at the top: "Owner name" (text), "Available minutes per day" (number, 15–600), and "Preferred time of day" (selectbox: morning / afternoon / evening). These update the live `Owner` object in session state on every render.

**Pet section** — five fields: "Pet name" (text), "Species" (selectbox: dog / cat / other), "Breed" (text), "Age" (number, 0–30), and "Special needs" (text area, one need per line). Clicking **Add Pet** instantiates a `Pet`, appends it to the `pets` list in session state, and immediately renders the pet's full profile via `pet.get_care_profile()` as an expandable JSON block. If the pet has any special needs, a yellow warning badge lists them; otherwise a green success toast confirms the save. Clicking Add Pet also validates that age is at least 1 — a zero age is rejected with an error — and if a pet with the same name and age already exists, a warning appears with a confirmation button that must be clicked before the duplicate is saved.

**Active pet selector** — once two or more pets exist, a selectbox labeled "Active pet" appears so you can switch context between registered pets. All subsequent task additions and schedule generation are scoped to whichever pet is selected here.

**Tasks section** — five inline columns: "Task title" (text), "Duration (minutes)" (number, 1–240), "Priority" (selectbox: low / medium / high), "Scheduled time" (text, placeholder `e.g. 08:00`), and "Preferred time of day" (selectbox: morning / afternoon / evening). Clicking **Add task** runs three validations in order: title must be non-empty, scheduled time must be non-empty, and scheduled time must match the `\d{2}:\d{2}` pattern — any failure shows a red error and rejects the entry.

**Current tasks table** — once at least one task exists, a table renders one row per task with eight columns: task name, scheduled time, duration, priority, completion status (✓ Done or Pending), a date label (Today / Tomorrow / month-day for anything further out), a **Mark complete** button, and a **Remove** button. Clicking **Mark complete** calls `task.mark_complete()`; if the task is recurring and not yet completed, the next occurrence is added to the owner's task list automatically and a success message shows the new date. Clicking **Remove** calls `owner.remove_task()` and reruns the page.

**Generate schedule** — the button at the bottom filters the owner's task list to only the active pet's tasks, constructs a `Schedule` for today, calls `schedule.generate()` against the owner's available-minutes budget, and then renders four sub-sections in sequence:

1. **Generated plan** — a success banner with `schedule.get_summary()` (and a warning for any skipped tasks).
2. **Sorted by Time** — a table produced by `schedule.sort_by_time()`, showing each task name and its scheduled time in chronological order.
3. **Conflict Warnings** — output of `schedule.detect_conflicts()`; tasks sharing the exact same `scheduled_time` are each flagged with a red error banner; a green banner confirms no conflicts when none exist.
4. **Filter by Status** — a radio button (All / Completed / Incomplete) feeds `schedule.filter_tasks(completed=...)` and renders the matching tasks as a table.

Everything on the page is scoped to the currently selected active pet; switching pets and regenerating produces an independent schedule for that pet.

**Example multi-pet workflow:**

1. Fill in the owner form — "Alex Rivera", 120 min/day, morning.
2. Add the first pet — "Luna", dog, Labrador, age 3, no special needs → profile card appears.
3. Add the second pet — "Mochi", cat, Domestic Shorthair, age 5, special needs: "kidney diet" → profile card appears with yellow warning badge.
4. With Luna selected as active pet, add two tasks: "Morning Walk" (30 min, high, 08:00, morning) and "Feeding" (10 min, medium, 08:30, morning).
5. Click **Generate schedule** — the plan for Luna appears, sorted view shows 08:00 then 08:30, no conflicts, filter radio lets you inspect completed vs. incomplete tasks.
6. Switch active pet to **Mochi** in the selector. Add Mochi's tasks: "Feeding" (10 min, medium, 08:00, morning) and "Medication" (5 min, high, 08:00, morning) — intentionally the same time to demonstrate conflict detection.
7. Click **Generate schedule** — the plan for Mochi appears; the Conflict Warnings section flags "Feeding" and "Medication" both at 08:00 in red. Luna's schedule is unaffected.
8. Mark a task complete on either pet to see the next recurring occurrence appended to the task list and the date label update accordingly.

## 💭 Reflection

Extending a system I already understood made it much easier to isolate what the new AI feature was actually responsible for, versus behavior inherited from the original design. The main lesson from this phase was that verifying an AI-generated fix means checking the actual math, not just whether tests pass or the tool claims a change was made correctly.
